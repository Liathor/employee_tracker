## Installation
Install all the files. Then run the SQL schema and seeds files to build and populate the database. Next you will need to rename the env.example file to .env, and put your SQL username and password in there. Once you have that done, open a terminal window in the main folder, and run 'npm i' to install all the required dependencies for the application. You are now ready to run the program.

## Usage
Open a terminal window in the main folder of the application, and type 'npm start'. This will build and execute the program. You can then navigate the employee manager in the terminal using the arrow keys and the enter key. For a more detailed walkthrough on using the program, please refer to the video below:
